          <h1 className={sectionTitleClass}>BULLET VIBRATORS</h1>
          <p className={sectionContentClass}>
            In terms of first sexual toys, it is recommended to use a bullet
            vibrator – small and rather unobtrusive, but versatile. This sex toy
            is strong on vibrations and hence is able to precisely vibrate the
            sensitive areas such as the clitoris. Because of its dimension, it
            is easy to maneuver and perfect for individual or couple use.
            However, some people may feel that its vibration is not as powerful
            as the large vibrators, although it should be noted that this is
            quite subjective. In conclusion, the bullet vibrator is probably one
            of the best toys for beginners who dream about the wonderful world
            of Sexual satisfaction.

            the shaft with internal ribbing and the bunny clitoral stimulator.
            However, it comes with strong sensations and various vibration
            settings though may be big and unattractive to some users. In fact,
            the rabbit vibrator is very suitable for first timers because the
            tool is relatively versatile while bringing much satisfaction.

            into the anus and as a result, fills up and enhances the
            satisfaction level of the couple. Advantages include, the

            more appropriate for beginners who have never experimented with the
            butt play since it has rather moderate length and is easy to
            operate.

            design and Low battery operation, and easy to cleaning. However,

        <div className={containerClass}>
          <h1 className={sectionTitleClass}>CLITORAL SUCTION TOY</h1>
          <p className={sectionContentClass}>
            Clitoral suction devices are those devices that work on the
            principle of applying pressure on the clitoris through blowing air
            with the help of tubes, which in fact gives a strong experience of
            pleasure. These devices are convenient for beginners most of the
            time as they create a different vibe thus producing easy and strong
            sessions. The benefits may be carried out hands-free and accurate
            stimulation, whereas the problematic areas are the high cost
            compared to the competitor and the overly stimulation. When it comes
            to the choice of devices, it is better to choose the devices with
            the adjustable settings and start with the lower intensity setting.
